# Thorough Reading of Attached Links/URLs

Ensure that the agent thoroughly reads and understands any attached links or URLs before generating responses, particularly when dealing with API documentation.

      When ensuring thorough reading of URLs:

      1. **Read Thoroughly**: The agent must read through the entire content of the attached link or URL, especially if it is an API document.

      2. **Adhere to Documentation**: When generating code based on an API document, the agent must stick closely to the instructions and examples provided in the document.

      3. **Avoid Hallucinations**: The agent must avoid generating information or code that is not explicitly supported by the content of the URL.

      4. **Verify Information**: Cross-check the information from the URL with the response to ensure accuracy and consistency.

      5. **Use Examples**: Where possible, use examples from the documentation to illustrate the response.

      6. **Clarify Ambiguities**: If there is any ambiguity in the documentation, the agent should seek clarification before proceeding with code generation.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Generated code does not adhere to API documentation
      incorrect-code-example

      # Good: Generated code adheres to API documentation
      correct-code-example
    output: "Correctly generated code based on thorough reading of API documentation"
